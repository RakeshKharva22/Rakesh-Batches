Loops in C Programming: 

Loops : Repeating the same task again and again
	is called as Loop.

3 important facts in Loop.

1) intialization
2) condition
3) updation

1) while loop
			
syntax : 	
		initialization;	  // i = 1;	

		while(condition)  // i <= 100
		{
			statement;
			updation; 
		}

-> It is called Entry Controlled Loop.
  If condition is true , so go inside the body.
  If condition is false , so go outside the body. 
  No Semicolon.

2) do..while()

syntax : 	
		intialization
		
		do
		{
		   statement;
		   updation;
		}
		while(condition);

It is Exit Controlled Loop.
It will execute body atleast once, even if the condition is false.
Semicolon after while.

3) for  loop

intialization,condition,updation all in one line

syntax : 
		for( initialization;condition;updation)
		{
			statement;	
		}
