/*
 *  Polymorphism :  Poly -> Many
 *  				morphism -> Forms.
 *  
 *   There are 2 Types of Polymorphism
 *   
 *   1) Compile-Time Polymorphism : It is also called as Static Polymorphism. (Early Binding)
 *   
 *    					e.g Method-overloading 
 *    
 *   2) Run-Time Polymorphism :  It is also called as Dynamic Polymorphism.   (Late Binding).
 *   		
 *   					e.g Method-overriding.
 *  
 * 
 *  Method-overriding : It is same return-type,same function-name and same parameters.
 *  					Same Signature.
 *  
 *  
 *  Method-overloading : Same Function-name, but different Parameters and different return-type.
